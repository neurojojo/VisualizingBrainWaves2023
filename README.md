# Visualizing Brain Waves Workshop

Objectives: To introduce students to Python programming through learning about brain waves and EEGs. This course is currently designed as a two-day, 6-hour in-person workshop. Throughout [Part I: Brain Waves](https://github.com/pkoneill/VisualizingBrainWaves/blob/main/README.md#part-ii-analyzing-eeg-data), students will learn about the history of the EEG as well as how the coordinated electrical activity of billions of neurons produces brain waves of different frequencies. During the interactive section, they will enter a virtual neurophysiology lab to familiarize themselves with neural activity and the different frequences of brain waves commonly recorded using an EEG. 

In [Part II: Analyzing EEG Data](https://github.com/pkoneill/VisualizingBrainWaves/blob/main/README.md#part-ii-analyzing-eeg-data), students will become familiar with the basic electrical components of an EEG circuit which collects, filters, and amplifies signals from the brain so that the patterns in these signals can be analyzed. In the tutorial segments of Part II, students will first use Python to interactively explore these concepts further. Then, in the final tutorial, students will import a human EEG data set, extract features of the signal and create visualizations.
