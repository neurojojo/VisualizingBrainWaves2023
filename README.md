# Visualizing Brain Waves Workshop
March 27, 2021

Objectives: To introduce students to Python programming through learning about brain waves and EEGs. This course is currently designed as a 4-hour virtual workshop. Throughout [Part I: Brain Waves](https://github.com/pkoneill/VisualizingBrainWaves/blob/main/README.md#part-ii-analyzing-eeg-data), students will learn about the history of the EEG as well as how the coordinated electrical activity of billions of neurons produces brain waves of different frequencies. During the Colab tutorial section, they will familiarize themselves with different frequences of brain waves commonly recorded using an EEG. During [Part II: Analyzing EEG Data](https://github.com/pkoneill/VisualizingBrainWaves/blob/main/README.md#part-ii-analyzing-eeg-data), we will outline the basic electrical components of an EEG circuit that collects, filters, and amplifies signals from the brain so that their patterns can be analyzed. In the tutorial segment of Part II, students will write Python code that uploads an EEG data set and plots brain waves. Finally, using a graphic design program based on Python code, students will create artistic represenation of their data.
